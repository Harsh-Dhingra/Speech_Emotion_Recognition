# Speech Emotion Recognition with RAVEDNESS Dataset

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using neural networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The RAVEDNESS dataset is utilized for training and evaluation.

## Dataset

- **RAVEDNESS Dataset**: [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)

Please download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Model Architecture

We have implemented two main models for SER:

1. **Neural Network (NN) Model**: A feedforward neural network designed for SER.

2. **LSTM Model**: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model tailored for sequence data in SER.

You can find the code for these models in their respective directories.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Organize the dataset as specified in the dataset section.

3. Train and test the models by running the respective scripts.

4. Evaluate the model performance, and visualize the results.

## Results

We have obtained the following results:
